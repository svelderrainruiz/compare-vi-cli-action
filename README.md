# Compare VI CLI Action

Placeholder README for the Compare VI CLI action workspace. Update this file with

## Fork-Aware Operations

- Use the new fork guard composite in .github/actions/fork-guard to suppress mutation when testing in forks.
- Release helpers auto-detect forks; run live pushes from the upstream worktree or use the automation commands.
