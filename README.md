# Compare VI CLI Action

## Overview

This repository hosts the reusable workflows and helper scripts that drive manual
LVCompare runs against commits in a LabVIEW project. The primary entrypoint is the
`Manual VI Compare (refs)` workflow, which walks a branch/ref history, extracts the
target VI at each commit-parent pair, and invokes LVCompare in headless mode.

The latest rev streamlines the workflow inputs so SMEs only need to provide:

1. The branch/tag/commit to inspect (`compare_ref`, defaults to `HEAD`)
2. The repository-relative VI path (`vi_path`)

Additional knobs remain available but defaulted so most runs require no extra
tuning.

## Quick start

### GitHub UI

1. Navigate to **Actions -> Manual VI Compare (refs)**.
2. Click **Run workflow**.
3. Supply `vi_path` (for example `Fixtures/Loop.vi`) and, optionally,
   `compare_ref` if you want something other than the workflow branch tip.
4. Run the workflow. The job summary includes a Markdown table of processed
   pairs, diff counts, and missing entries per mode; any differences raise a
   warning that points at the uploaded diff artifacts.

### CLI (gh)

```powershell
gh workflow run vi-compare-refs.yml `
  -f vi_path='Fixtures/Loop.vi' `
  -f compare_ref='develop'
```

Use `gh run watch <run-id>` or the rendered summary to follow progress. The
workflow uploads two artifacts:

- `vi-compare-manifests` - aggregate suite manifest and per-mode summaries
- `vi-compare-diff-artifacts` - only present when LVCompare detects differences

Each job also emits GitHub outputs pointing at the aggregate manifest, the
history results directory, the per-mode manifest summary (`mode-manifests-json`),
and the generated history report paths (`history-report-md` and, when HTML
renders, `history-report-html`). Downstream workflows and reusable snippets can
consume those keys to surface the Markdown/HTML report or to dispatch follow-up
automation without spelunking the artifacts. When the renderer is unavailable,
`Compare-VIHistory.ps1` writes a lightweight fallback report so the Markdown
output key always resolves to a readable summary.

Provide the optional `notify_issue` input when dispatching the workflow to post
the same summary table to a GitHub issue for stakeholders.

### PR staging helper at a glance

- Comment `/vi-stage` on a pull request (or run `gh workflow run pr-vi-staging.yml -f pr=<number>`).
- The workflow stages VI pairs via `tools/Invoke-PRVIStaging.ps1`, runs LVCompare on each, and posts a summary comment
  with staged/skipped counts, AllowSameLeaf totals, mode breakdown, and LVCompare results. A collapsible table mirrors
  the Markdown summary artifact and is generated by `tools/Summarize-VIStaging.ps1`, so it flags the compare categories
  (front panel, block diagram functional/cosmetic, VI attributes) that triggered for each pair and now includes a
  **Flags** column that lists the LVCompare mode(s) executed and the flag bundle applied.
- Artifacts: `vi-compare-manifest` (manifest + summary) and `vi-compare-staging` (numbered `vi-staging-XX.zip`
  bundles). Each pair’s `compare/` directory now includes `compare-report.html` plus a `compare-report_files/` folder
  containing the 2025 LVCompare image assets (set `COMPAREVI_REPORT_FORMAT=html-single` if you need the legacy single-file
  artifact).
- Labels: successful runs add `vi-staging-ready` (input configurable) and remove it automatically if staging fails or
  finds no pairs.
- Flag overrides: set repository variables `VI_STAGE_COMPARE_FLAGS_MODE` (defaults to `replace`), `VI_STAGE_COMPARE_FLAGS`
  (newline-separated list), and `VI_STAGE_COMPARE_REPLACE_FLAGS` to control LVCompare ignore bundles. Even when filters
  are configured, the workflow also runs an unsuppressed `full` pass so block diagram/front panel edits remain visible;
  both passes and their flag sets appear in the summary's **Flags** column.
- Smoke coverage: `npm run smoke:vi-stage -- --DryRun` prints the plan; `npm run smoke:vi-stage` pushes a scratch branch
  using the baked-in `fixtures/vi-attr` pair so every run produces deterministic LVCompare output.

### Automatic VI compare for fork pull requests

- The `VI Compare (Fork PR)` workflow runs on every pull request that targets `develop`, including forks. The helper
  uses a custom fetch action so the fork head commit is checked out safely, generates a diff manifest, stages pairs,
  runs LVCompare, and uploads compare reports for reviewers.
- The job is read-only (no pushes or release writes) and produces the same artifact layout as `/vi-stage`, giving
  reviewers deterministic bundles without manual staging. The workflow executes on the trusted self-hosted Windows
  runner (`self-hosted, Windows, X64`) so the same LVCompare install used in CI handles fork PRs.
- Manual `/vi-stage` and `/vi-history` dispatches accept a `fetch_depth` input (default `20`) when you need to pull a
  deeper history for local tests.
- To rehearse the fork flow locally, run `pwsh -File tools/Test-ForkSimulation.ps1` in three passes: `-DryRun` shows the
  steps, the default run opens a draft PR and validates the automatic compare job, and `-KeepBranch` preserves the
  scratch branch while the staging/history dispatches finish so you can inspect the artifacts.

## Optional inputs

| Input name                 | Default   | Description                                                                 |
| -------------------------- | --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `compare_depth`            | `0`       | Maximum commit pairs to evaluate (`0` = no limit)                           |
| `compare_modes`            | `default` | Comma/semicolon list of compare modes (`default,attributes,front-panel`) |
| `compare_ignore_flags`     | `none`    | LVCompare ignore toggles (`none`, `default`, or comma-separated flags)      |
| `compare_additional_flags` | ` `       | Extra LVCompare switches (space-delimited)                                  |
| `compare_fail_fast`        | `false`   | Stop after the first diff                                                   |
| `compare_fail_on_diff`     | `false`   | Fail the workflow when any diff is detected                                 |
| `sample_id`                | _(empty)_ | Optional concurrency key (advanced use)                                     |
| `notify_issue`             | _(empty)_ | Issue number to receive the summary table as a comment                      |

These inputs map directly onto the parameters in `tools/Compare-VIHistory.ps1`,
so advanced behaviour remains available without cluttering the default UX.

## Local helper

You can run the same compare logic locally:

```powershell
pwsh -NoLogo -NoProfile -File tools/Compare-VIHistory.ps1 `
  -TargetPath Fixtures/Loop.vi `
  -StartRef develop `
  -Detailed `
  -RenderReport
```

If LabVIEW/LVCompare is not available locally, point the helper at the bundled stub:

```powershell
pwsh -NoLogo -NoProfile -File tools/Compare-VIHistory.ps1 `
  -TargetPath fixtures/vi-stage/bd-cosmetic/Head.vi `
  -StartRef develop `
  -MaxSignalPairs 1 `
  -NoisePolicy collapse `
  -InvokeScriptPath tests/stubs/Invoke-LVCompare.stub.ps1 `
  -Detailed -RenderReport -KeepArtifactsOnNoDiff
```

For a quick summary without digging through JSON, run:

```powershell
pwsh -NoLogo -NoProfile -File tools/Inspect-HistorySignalStats.ps1 -Verbose
```

Before running with the real LabVIEW CLI, verify your setup:

```powershell
pwsh -NoLogo -NoProfile -File tools/Verify-LVCompareSetup.ps1 -ProbeCli
```

The helper now processes every reachable commit pair by default. Supply
`-MaxPairs <n>` when you need to cap the history for large or exploratory runs.
Pass `-IncludeMergeParents` to audit merge parents alongside the mainline; the
extra comparisons surface lineage metadata (parent index, branch head, depth)
so reports and manifests call out where each revision originated.
Signal-first helpers are built in: use `-MaxSignalPairs <n>` (default `2`) to
limit the number of surfaced signal diffs and `-NoisePolicy include|collapse|skip`
(default `collapse`) to decide whether cosmetic-only changes are emitted,
aggregated, or skipped entirely.

Artifacts are written under `tests/results/ref-compare/history/` using the same
schema as the workflow outputs.

For a quicker end-to-end loop:

- `scripts/Run-VIHistory.ps1` regenerates the history results, prints the
  enriched Markdown summary (including attribute coverage), surfaces the first
  commit pairs it processed, writes `tests/results/ref-compare/history/history-context.json`
  with commit metadata, and renders `tests/results/ref-compare/history/history-report.md`
  (plus `history-report.html` when `-HtmlReport`) so reviewers get a single document
  with author/date context, diff outcome, and relative links to the preserved LVCompare
  report and artifact directory whenever a difference is detected. If the
  renderer throws or is missing, the script falls back to a lightweight Markdown
  stub so downstream tooling still has a report to reference.
- `scripts/Dispatch-VIHistoryWorkflow.ps1` wraps `gh workflow run` and echoes
  the URL to the most recent run so you can follow progress immediately.

Need a quick, local verification of LVCompare/LabVIEWCLI behaviour? Use
`tools/Verify-LocalDiffSession.ps1`:

```powershell
# Stubbed run (no LabVIEW required)
pwsh -NoLogo -NoProfile -File tools/Verify-LocalDiffSession.ps1 `
  -BaseVi fixtures/vi-stage/bd-cosmetic/Base.vi `
  -HeadVi fixtures/vi-stage/bd-cosmetic/Head.vi `
  -UseStub -Mode duplicate-window -SentinelTtlSeconds 10
```

The helper writes summary JSON under `tests/results/_agent/local-diff/<timestamp>/`
and prints a one-line overview for each run (exit code, whether CLI was skipped,
suppression reason, and output directory). The summary JSON includes the captured
stdout/stderr snippets, sentinel path (when applicable), and snapshots of
LabVIEW/LVCompare/LabVIEWCLI processes before/after each invocation.

- Modes include `normal`, `cli-suppressed`, `git-context`, and `duplicate-window`
  so you can validate the environment and sentinel guards without waiting for CI.
- For quick iterations open the VS Code Tasks palette and run either
  **Local: Verify diff session (stub)** or **Local: Verify diff session (real)**. The
  real task will probe LVCompare/LabVIEWCLI and can be combined with the helper’s
  `-AutoConfig` switch (or run `tools/New-LVCompareConfig.ps1`) to scaffold a
  local `configs/labview-paths.local.json` automatically when the setup isn’t ready.

To bootstrap LVCompare/LabVIEWCLI paths, run:

```powershell
pwsh -NoLogo -NoProfile -File tools/New-LVCompareConfig.ps1 -Probe
```

The command discovers installed binaries, prompts for overrides (or pass
`-NonInteractive` to accept defaults), writes `configs/labview-paths.local.json`,
and optionally verifies the configuration with `Verify-LVCompareSetup.ps1 -ProbeCli`.
Verify-LocalDiffSession's `-AutoConfig` parameter uses the same helper when
`-ProbeSetup` fails.

The helper also maintains a `versions` map keyed by LabVIEW release and bitness.
Detection is automatic when the LabVIEW path resembles `LabVIEW 2024 (32-bit)`,
and you can override it with `-Version <year>` / `-Bitness 32|64` to register
multiple installs. Re-running with `-Force` merges additional version entries
instead of discarding existing ones, so the config can track several LabVIEW
installations side by side. Pass `-LabVIEWVersion` / `-LabVIEWBitness` to
`Verify-LocalDiffSession.ps1` (or select the new VS Code task prompts) if you
need the auto-config step to target a specific installation explicitly. The
helper always resolves the 64-bit shared LVCompare path
(`C:\Program Files\National Instruments\Shared\LabVIEW Compare\LVCompare.exe`)
so diff capture consistently uses the supported engine even when 32-bit
components are installed.
Pass `-Stateless` when calling `Verify-LocalDiffSession.ps1` if you want each
run to re-discover LVCompare/LabVIEWCLI and remove the auto-generated
`configs/labview-paths.local.json` afterwards (a VS Code task entry is available
for this mode as well).

Need to point the tools at non-default LabVIEW/LVCompare installs? Copy
`configs/labview-paths.sample.json` to `configs/labview-paths.json` and list any
custom paths under the `lvcompare` and `labview` arrays; the resolvers consult
those entries before falling back to environment variables and canonical Program
Files locations. Run commands with `-Verbose` if you need to inspect the
candidate list while debugging.

For quick iteration, call `tools/Run-LocalDiffSession.ps1` (or use the updated
VS Code tasks). The wrapper delegates to `Verify-LocalDiffSession.ps1`, then
copies the run output to `tests/results/_agent/local-diff/latest/` and zips the
same payload to `tests/results/_agent/local-diff/latest.zip` so reports,
captures, and CLI logs are immediately available after each run (the stub task
archives to `latest-stub/` / `latest-stub.zip`).
The helper now runs LVCompare with no ignore filters by default so the full
signal is captured; pass `-NoiseProfile legacy` (or use the “legacy noise” VS
Code task) to restore the previous suppression bundle
(`-noattr -nofp -nofppos -nobd -nobdcosm`) when you need a quieter diff.

## Release and compatibility

Renaming the workflow inputs breaks compatibility with previous revisions, so the
next release should cut a new major tag (for example `v1.0.0`). Update downstream
automation or scheduled triggers to use the new `vi_path` / `compare_ref` inputs
before adopting the release.
