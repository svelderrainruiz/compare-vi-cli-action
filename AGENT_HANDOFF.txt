# Agent Handoff – Compare VI CLI Action

## Context Snapshot
- Branch: `issue/88-dev-dashboard-phase2` (tracking #88 and PR #100)
- Primary focus: live watcher tooling, busy-loop detection, lint strategy hardening
- Latest changes (not yet committed in this session):
  - Docs refreshed (`README.md`, `docs/DEV_DASHBOARD_PLAN.md`) with watcher heartbeat/trim notes plus lint roadmap.
  - `tools/Dev-WatcherManager.ps1` + `tools/follow-pester-artifacts.mjs` now emit both status and heartbeat JSON (`watcher-self.json`) with freshness checks; unit suites exist (`tests/Watcher.Live.Tests.ps1`, `tests/Watcher.BusyLoop.Tests.ps1`, `tests/DevWatcherManager.Tests.ps1`).
  - Markdown lint tooling staged (`.markdownlint.jsonc`, `.markdownlintignore`, `tools/Lint-Markdown.ps1`, npm scripts) alongside workflow updates; lint script is wired into `npm run lint:md(:changed)`.

## Status & Known Gaps
1. **Watcher behaviour**
   - Initial status often reports `busy-watch` / `busy-suspect` until Pester emits `[It ...]` lines (documented).
   - Heartbeat now writes `watcher-self.json` with timestamps/metrics; `verifiedProcess` degrades when the heartbeat goes stale. Manual trim via `npm run dev:watcher:trim` is available but not automated yet.
   - `npm run dev:watcher:stop` clears PID/status/heartbeat files; status + heartbeat JSON now surface `heartbeatFresh`, `heartbeatReason`, and `needsTrim` hints.
2. **Lint backlog**
   - `npm run lint:md:changed` now targets PR deltas and CI uses it for blocking checks; full sweeps stay notice-only.
   - Legacy docs still trip MD013/MD012/MD041 (line length + blank lines). Capture backlog in follow-up issue or staged fixes.
3. **Automation**
   - Use `tools/Print-AgentHandoff.ps1 -ApplyToggles` to surface watcher telemetry automatically during hand-offs. It prints a concise summary and writes `tests/results/_agent/handoff/watcher-telemetry.json`.
   - Add `-AutoTrim` (or set `HANDOFF_AUTOTRIM=1`) to trim oversized watcher logs when `needsTrim=true` and cooldown permits.

## Suggested Next Actions
1. Standardize on `tools/Print-AgentHandoff.ps1 -ApplyToggles (-AutoTrim)` in automation to surface `heartbeatFresh`, `heartbeatReason`, and `needsTrim` without extra commands.
2. Keep auto-trim event-driven (only when `needsTrim=true`) with a 900s cooldown; revisit thresholds after telemetry review.
3. Triage markdown backlog: capture MD013/MD012 hot spots, decide whether to patch docs or stage suppression for generated blocks.
4. After code changes, rerun:
   ```powershell
   Import-Module Pester
   Invoke-Pester tests/Watcher.Live.Tests.ps1, tests/Watcher.BusyLoop.Tests.ps1, tests/DevWatcherManager.Tests.ps1
   npm run lint:md:changed
   ```

## Useful Commands
- Start persistent watcher: `npm run dev:watcher:ensure`
- Check status JSON: `npm run dev:watcher:status`
- Stop watcher/clear status: `npm run dev:watcher:stop`
- Trim watcher logs: `npm run dev:watcher:trim`
- Auto-trim and print summary: `pwsh -File tools/Print-AgentHandoff.ps1 -AutoTrim`
- Fail-fast during repro: `npm run watch:pester:fast:exit` (hang & busy detection)

## Notes for Next Agent
- If the watcher status reads `busy-suspect` immediately after ensure, that's expected warm-up; re-check once tests are running.
- `dev:watcher:status` now reports `needsTrim`; run `npm run dev:watcher:trim` or rely on `Print-AgentHandoff.ps1 -AutoTrim` when set to keep logs manageable.
- When documenting future changes, keep README's "Known gaps" section in sync.
