Deterministic Runs Hand-off — Updated 2025-10-09 @ 06:00 UTC

Context Snapshot
- Branch: `issue/88-dev-dashboard-phase2`
- Issue/PR: #88 (open), PR #100 (open against develop; blocked by VI Binary Handling Gate)
- Latest commits on branch:
  * 5865fca — ci(binary-gate): enable manual dispatch (#88)
  * eddc4b0 — ci(binary-gate): ensure Pester v5 is installed for self-hosted run (#88)
  * 80b9b09 — fix(dispatcher): remove Seed parameter to avoid Import-Module metadata error (#88)
  * 71c6a3b — fix: harden fixture drift notice verification (#88)
- Recent workflow highlights:
  * Fixture Drift (Windows) run `18364793531` — SUCCESS (notice gate hardened)
  * VI Binary Handling Gate `18364792683` — FAILURE (Pester missing) [pre-fix]
  * VI Binary Handling Gate `18366644622` — FAILURE (watch smoke step before install fix)
  * VI Binary Handling Gate `18366961863` — FAILURE in Preflight (self-hosted): "Verify LVCompare and idle LabVIEW state"

Top Priorities for Next Agent
1) Diagnose self-hosted Windows preflight failure in run `18366961863`:
   - Confirm LVCompare exists at canonical path: `C:\Program Files\National Instruments\Shared\LabVIEW Compare\LVCompare.exe`.
   - Ensure `LabVIEW.exe` is not running prior to tests.
   - Re-run the gate after runner fix (manual dispatch now enabled).
2) Once preflight succeeds, verify Pester v5 is installed (workflow sets `install_pester: true`) and that the Pester job executes the binary-handling tests.
3) When the VI Binary Handling Gate is green, verify PR #100 has all checks passing and proceed to merge policy for #88.
4) If additional regressions surface (watch-mode or telemetry), capture logs and update PR/issue with remediation steps.

Environment Preconditions (local & CI)
- `$env:LV_SUPPRESS_UI = '1'`
- `$env:LV_NO_ACTIVATE = '1'`
- `$env:LV_CURSOR_RESTORE = '1'`
- `$env:LVCI_SINGLE_COMPARE = '1'`
- `$env:SESSION_LOCK_ENABLED = '1'` and `$env:SESSION_LOCK_STRICT = '1'`
- Repo vars: `CLEAN_LV_BEFORE=true`, `CLEAN_LV_AFTER=true`, `CLEAN_LV_INCLUDE_COMPARE=true`
- Optional telemetry: `$env:EMIT_LV_CLOSURE_CRUMBS = '1'`

Recent Changes / What’s Fixed
- Fixture Drift Windows notice gate hardened; tolerates missing path and falls back to `_lv` directory, surfaces counts in step summary.
- Dispatcher metadata error resolved by removing the `Seed` parameter from `Invoke-PesterTests.ps1`.
- VI Binary Handling Gate now installs Pester v5 to ensure `New-PesterConfiguration` is present.
- Manual dispatch enabled for the VI Binary Handling Gate (`workflow_dispatch`).

Open Issues / Pending Work
- Self-hosted runner failing LVCompare preflight (run `18366961863`): fix runner state or adjust preflight expectations if policy allows.
- After the runner fix, re-dispatch the gate and ensure the Pester job executes `tests/ViBinaryHandling.Tests.ps1`.
- When both drift and binary gates are green, finalize PR #100 for merge.

Useful Commands & Scripts
- Manual gate dispatch: `gh workflow run vi-binary-gate.yml -r issue/88-dev-dashboard-phase2`
- Track runs: `gh run list --workflow "VI Binary Handling Gate" --json databaseId,status,conclusion,headBranch,url`
- Inspect job logs: `gh run view <runId> --json jobs` then call the job logs API for details.
- Local quick checks: `pwsh -File tools/Quick-DispatcherSmoke.ps1 -PreferWorkspace`
- Validate fixtures: `pwsh -File tools/Validate-Fixtures.ps1 -Json`
- Local fixture harness (TestStand thin wrapper): `pwsh -File tools/TestStand-CompareHarness.ps1 -LabVIEWPath <path> -CloseLabVIEW`

Artifacts & Logs to Review After Runs
- Gate run summaries and artifacts: `pester-results`, `pester-totals.json`, dev-dashboard (`dashboard.html/.json`).
- Self-hosted preflight logs for LVCompare presence/idle LabVIEW diagnostics.
- Fixture Drift results: `results/fixture-drift/**/drift-summary.json`, `fixture-verify-summary.json`.

Reminder
- Keep commits scoped; reference `#88` in commit subjects.
- Use “brief delay (~90 seconds)” etiquette for propagation waits and record with agent-wait tools.
