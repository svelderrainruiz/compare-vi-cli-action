# Agent Handoff - Compare VI CLI Action

## Context Snapshot
- Standing priority refreshed via `npm run priority:sync`; cache still points to issue #134
  (`Standing priority: evolve CompareVI helper into N-provider CLI companion`). The sync now uses the
  installed GitHub CLI but still falls back to cached metadata because the workspace lacks
  authentication (`gh auth login` or `GH_TOKEN`).
- Working tree currently on branch `work`; `issue/134-cli-companion` is not present locally.
- LabVIEW safety toggles exported in this shell (`LV_SUPPRESS_UI=1`, `LV_NO_ACTIVATE=1`,
  `LV_CURSOR_RESTORE=1`, `LV_IDLE_WAIT_SECONDS=2`, `LV_IDLE_MAX_WAIT_SECONDS=5`).
- Restored package manager access and installed PowerShell 7.5.3 via the Microsoft APT repository.
  `tools/Print-AgentHandoff.ps1 -ApplyToggles -AutoTrim` now launches successfully (still reporting
  cached standing-issue metadata because `gh` is unauthenticated).
- Ran `tools/Detect-RogueLV.ps1 -ResultsDir tests/results -LookBackSeconds 900 -AppendToStepSummary`;
  no rogue LabVIEW or LVCompare processes detected.
- `npm run priority:handoff-tests` (Node shim) re-ran and refreshed
  `tests/results/_agent/handoff/test-summary.json` (captured 2025-10-16T02:58Z).
- Schema validation re-run with the placeholder TestStand session data via `node
  dist/tools/schemas/validate-json.js --schema
  docs/schema/generated/teststand-compare-session.schema.json --data
  tests/results/teststand-session/session-index.json`; command succeeds (latest run timestamped
  2025-10-16T02:58Z).
- Updated handoff telemetry recorded in `tests/results/_agent/handoff/test-summary.json`
  (`agent-handoff/test-results@v1`) capturing the new shim execution. The rogue scan produced a clean
  report (no additional artifacts created).

## Status & Known Gaps
1. GitHub CLI is installed but unauthenticated, so standing-priority syncs still fall back to the
   cached metadata. Supply `GH_TOKEN` or run `gh auth login` to refresh directly from GitHub.
2. TestStand session artifacts (`tests/results/teststand-session/session-index.json`) and CLI-only
   outputs remain placeholders; schema validation and documentation still depend on real runs from a
   LabVIEW-capable environment.
3. Dispatcher sweep (`Invoke-PesterTests.ps1 -IntegrationMode exclude`) and targeted TestStand
   harness coverage have not run yet in this refreshed container.
4. Issue/PR context for #134 still needs updated notes once genuine artifacts and test coverage are
   produced (include CLI metadata, session capsules, validation status).

## Suggested Next Actions
1. Authenticate GitHub CLI (e.g., `gh auth login` or export `GH_TOKEN`) and rerun
   `npm run priority:sync` so the standing-priority cache reflects the live issue metadata.
2. Generate or copy fresh CLI-only and TestStand session artifacts on a LabVIEW-capable host;
   replace the placeholder data under `tests/results/teststand-session/` and populate the missing
   `tests/results/cli-only/` directory locally.
3. Re-run the schema validator once real artifacts exist:
   ```
   node dist/tools/schemas/validate-json.js \
     --schema docs/schema/generated/teststand-compare-session.schema.json \
     --data tests/results/teststand-session/session-index.json
   ```
4. Execute dispatcher coverage now that PowerShell is installed:
   - `pwsh -File Invoke-PesterTests.ps1 -IntegrationMode exclude`
   - Optionally `pwsh -File Invoke-PesterTests.ps1 -TestsPath tests/TestStand-CompareHarness.Tests.ps1`
5. Update issue/PR #134 with regenerated artifact notes, schema validation outcomes (highlight when
   placeholder data is replaced), and refreshed handoff/test summaries.

## First Actions for the Next Agent
1. Authenticate GitHub CLI (`gh auth login` or export `GH_TOKEN`) and rerun `npm run priority:sync`
   so the standing-priority cache reflects the live issue metadata.
2. Fetch or regenerate the missing `tests/results/teststand-session/` and `tests/results/cli-only/`
   directories so schema validation and documentation review can resume; replace the current
   placeholder TestStand session copy with genuine output.
3. Re-run `node dist/tools/schemas/validate-json.js ...` after swapping in real session data and
   capture the outcome in `tests/results/_agent/handoff/test-summary.json`.
4. Kick off `pwsh -File Invoke-PesterTests.ps1 -IntegrationMode exclude` (and targeted TestStand
   harness coverage) now that PowerShell is available; archive the resulting summaries for PR
   context.
5. Update issue/PR #134 with refreshed artifact notes, schema validation outcomes, and standing-prior
   ity cache status once the above steps complete.

## Notes for Next Agent
- Added a Node-based shim at `tools/priority/run-handoff-tests.mjs` so
  `npm run priority:handoff-tests` no longer requires PowerShell.
- `tests/results/_agent/handoff/test-summary.json` now records the refreshed Node-driven run
  (captured 2025-10-16T02:58Z) alongside earlier schema validation attempts.
- No watcher telemetry exists for this session; container still lacks `_agent/handoff/` watcher
  assets.
- `.agent_priority_cache.json` currently reflects cached metadata for issue #134 because the GitHub
  CLI is unauthenticated.
- Container image does not ship LabVIEW or LabVIEW CLI; expect to run compare/harness workflows on a
  Windows host with the required tooling.
- Schema validation still references the placeholder TestStand session data; replace once genuine
  artifacts are available.
