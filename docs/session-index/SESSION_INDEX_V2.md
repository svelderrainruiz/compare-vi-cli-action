# Session Index v2 – proposal

> Heroic goal: Turn the session index into the single source of truth for CI
> telemetry – rich enough to capture live branch protection state, per–test
> metadata, requirement traceability, and downstream artefact links.

## Objectives

1. **Typed service layer** – Generate session-index.json via a TypeScript module
   instead of direct PowerShell JSON manipulation.
2. **Extensible schema** – Expand beyond run summaries to include per-test
   metadata (requirements, rationale, expected results), artefact catalogues,
   live branch-protection snapshots, and diagnostic notes.
3. **Callback-friendly orchestration** – Provide pre/post hooks so Pester (or
   any harness) can emit structured test events that the writer consumes.
4. **Backwards compatibility** – Keep the existing v1 schema during migration.
   Producers opt into v2, consumers can reference both until the transition is
   complete.

Key differences from v1:

* `run` replaces the bare `runContext` block, with explicit trigger metadata.
* `tests.cases` stores per-test metadata that we can hydrate via pre/post
  callbacks inside the Pester harness.
* `branchProtection` contains both canonical and live contexts plus diagnostic
  notes (allowing us to log 403s / 404s without losing alignment).
* `artifacts` become first-class, linking to dashboards, compare reports, and
  trace matrices.
* `notes` is a free-form area for session-wide diagnostics.

## Implementation plan

1. **TypeScript builder (this PR)**  
   Introduce a typed builder that writes v2 objects, along with a CLI to emit
   sample indices. This keeps structure and validation in one place.

2. **PowerShell integration (follow-up)**  
   - Update existing scripts (e.g., Quick-DispatcherSmoke, Update-SessionIndexBranchProtection) to call the TypeScript CLI.
   - Provide thin PS wrappers so existing jobs don’t need to learn Node APIs.

3. **Per-test callbacks**  
   - Add a Pester shim that captures test metadata and streams it to the builder.
   - Populate `tests.cases` incrementally; fall back to summaries when callbacks
     are unavailable.

4. **Consumer migration**  
   - Update dashboards, trace matrices, and tooling to read v2.
   - Keep emitting v1 in parallel until all consumers understand v2.

5. **Deprecate v1**  
   - Once all jobs and dashboards read v2, freeze v1 generation and archive the
     old schema documentation.

## Open questions

* How much requirement metadata do we already track (e.g., via tags)?  
  We may need an annotation mechanism (`It '...' -TestMeta @{ Requirement =
  'REQ-1234' }`) to capture this cleanly.
* Do we need per-artifact checksums / sizes to help latency-sensitive tooling?
* Should branch-protection snapshots also include the raw API payload for
  auditability?

Feedback welcome before we harden the schema.
