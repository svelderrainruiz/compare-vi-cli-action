# Developer Guide

Quick reference for building, testing, and releasing the LVCompare composite action.

## Testing

- **Unit tests** (no LabVIEW required)
  - `./Invoke-PesterTests.ps1`
  - `pwsh -File tools/Run-Pester.ps1`
- **Integration tests** (LabVIEW + LVCompare installed)
  - Set `LV_BASE_VI`, `LV_HEAD_VI`
  - `./Invoke-PesterTests.ps1 -IntegrationMode include`
- **Helpers**
  - `tools/Dev-Dashboard.ps1` → telemetry snapshot
  - `tools/Watch-Pester.ps1` → file watcher / retry loop
  - `tools/Detect-RogueLV.ps1 -FailOnRogue` → leak check

Artifacts land in `tests/results/` (JSON summaries, XML, loop logs).

See `docs/plans/VALIDATION_MATRIX.md` for a standing-priority view of the major validation entry points, including
docker workflows and the integration gate. VS Code users can launch the same commands via the bundled tasks in
`.vscode/tasks.json` (Command Palette -> "Run Task"); leak-handling switches are already wired in so LabVIEW closes
after each sweep.

- macOS/Linux users must install PowerShell 7 and expose `pwsh` on `PATH` so the tasks can resolve the shell.
- When LabVIEW is unavailable, run `pwsh -File Invoke-PesterTests.ps1 -IntegrationMode exclude` manually and omit the
  leak-cleanup flags until the standing-priority tasks land on those platforms.

For container parity prerequisites and cleanup tips, refer to `docs/knowledgebase/DOCKER_TOOLS_PARITY.md`.

## Pull request hygiene

```powershell
pwsh -File tools/Check-PRMergeable.ps1 -Number <pr> -FailOnConflict
```

Use this after opening a PR to poll GitHub's mergeable state (exits non-zero when conflicts are detected).

## Building & linting

```powershell
node tools/npm/cli.mjs ci
node tools/npm/run-script.mjs build
node tools/npm/run-script.mjs generate:outputs
node tools/npm/run-script.mjs lint            # markdownlint + custom checks
./tools/PrePush-Checks.ps1  # actionlint, optional YAML round-trip
```

## Release checklist

1. Update `CHANGELOG.md`
2. Tag (semantic version, e.g. `v0.6.0`)
3. Push tag (release workflow auto-generates notes)
4. Update README usage examples to latest tag
5. Verify marketplace listing once published

## Branching model

- `develop` is the integration branch. All standing-priority work lands here via squash merges (linear history).
- `main` reflects the latest release. Use release branches to promote changes from `develop` to `main`.
- For standing-priority work, create `issue/<number>-<slug>` and merge back with squash once checks are green.
- Use short-lived `feature/<slug>` branches when parallel threads are needed. Rebase on `develop` frequently and
  open PRs with `npm run priority:pr`.
- When preparing a release:
  1. Create `release/<version>` from `develop` with `npm run release:branch`. The helper bumps `package.json`,
     pushes the branch to your fork, and opens a PR targeting `main`. Use `npm run release:branch:dry`
     when you want to rehearse the flow without touching remotes.
  2. Finish release-only work on feature branches targeting `release/<version>`.
  3. Merge the release branch into `main`, create the draft release, then fast-forward `develop`
     with `npm run release:finalize -- <version>`. The helper fast-forwards `main`, creates a draft
     GitHub release, fast-forwards `develop`, and records metadata under `tests/results/_agent/release/`.
     Use `npm run release:finalize:dry` to rehearse the flow without pushing.
     - The finalize helper blocks if the release PR has pending or failing checks; set
       `RELEASE_FINALIZE_SKIP_CHECKS=1` (or `RELEASE_FINALIZE_ALLOW_MERGED=1` / `RELEASE_FINALIZE_ALLOW_DIRTY=1`)
       to override in emergencies.
- When rehearsing feature branch work, use `npm run feature:branch:dry -- my-feature` and
  `npm run feature:finalize:dry -- my-feature` to simulate branch creation and finalization without touching remotes.
- Delete branches automatically after merging (GitHub setting) so the standing-priority flow starts clean each time.

### Release metadata

- Running the live helpers writes JSON snapshots under `tests/results/_agent/release/`:
  - `release-<tag>-branch.json` captures the release branch base, commits, and linked PR.
  - `release-<tag>-finalize.json` records the fast-forward results and the GitHub release draft.
- `priority:sync` surfaces the most recent artifact in the standing-priority step summary and exposes it to downstream
  automation via `snapshot.releaseArtifacts`.
- The release router now suggests `npm run release:finalize -- <version>` automatically when the latest branch artifact
  lacks a matching finalize record.

## Pull request & merge policy

- Branch protection requires a linear history: use the **Squash and merge** button (or rebase-and-merge) so no merge
  commits land on `develop`/`main`.
- Keep PRs focused and include the standing issue reference (`#<number>`) in the commit subject and PR description.
- Ensure required checks (`validate`, `fixtures`, `session-index`) are green before merging; rerun as needed.
- Run `npm run priority:policy` if you need to audit merge settings locally; the command also runs during
  `priority:handoff-tests` and fails when repo/branch policy drifts.
- Prefer opening PRs from your fork with `npm run priority:pr`; the helper ensures `origin` targets your fork (creating
  it via `gh repo fork` if needed), pushes the current branch, and calls
  `gh pr create --fill --repo <upstream> --base develop --head <fork>:branch`.
- Detailed enforcement notes (feature-branch guards, merge history workflow, merge queue parameters) live in
  [`docs/knowledgebase/FEATURE_BRANCH_POLICY.md`](./knowledgebase/FEATURE_BRANCH_POLICY.md).

## Dispatcher modules

- `scripts/Pester-Invoker.psm1` - per-file execution with crumbs (`pester-invoker/v1`)
- `scripts/Invoke-PesterSingleLoop.ps1` - outer loop runner (unit + integration)
- `scripts/Run-AutonomousIntegrationLoop.ps1` - latency/diff soak harness

## Watch mode tips

```powershell
$env:WATCH_RESULTS_DIR = 'tests/results/_watch'
pwsh -File tools/Watch-Pester.ps1 -RunAllOnStart -ChangedOnly
```

Artifacts: `watch-last.json`, `watch-log.ndjson`. Dev Dashboard surfaces these along with
queue telemetry and stakeholder contacts.

## Handoff telemetry & auto-trim

```powershell
pwsh -File tools/Print-AgentHandoff.ps1 -ApplyToggles -AutoTrim
```

- Surfaces watcher status inline (alive, verifiedProcess, heartbeatFresh/Reason, needsTrim).
- Emits a compact JSON snapshot to `tests/results/_agent/handoff/watcher-telemetry.json` and, when in CI,
  appends a summary block to the step summary.
- Auto-trim policy: if `needsTrim=true`, watcher logs are trimmed to the last ~4000 lines when either
  `-AutoTrim` is passed or `HANDOFF_AUTOTRIM=1` is set. Dev watcher also trims on start.
- Trim thresholds: ~5MB per log file; only oversized logs are trimmed.
- See [`WATCHER_TELEMETRY_DX.md`](./WATCHER_TELEMETRY_DX.md) for automation response expectations.

## Quick verification

```powershell
./tools/Quick-VerifyCompare.ps1                # temp files
./tools/Quick-VerifyCompare.ps1 -Same          # identical path preview
./tools/Quick-VerifyCompare.ps1 -Base A.vi -Head B.vi
```

Preview LVCompare command without executing:

```powershell
pwsh -File scripts/CompareVI.ps1 -Base VI1.vi -Head VI2.vi -LvCompareArgs "-nobdcosm" -PreviewArgs
```
